# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
Using _**Dynamic Arrays**_, _**Singly Linked Lists**_, _**Doubly Linked Lists on Array**_, _**Hashtables**_ and _**Binary Trees**_ to implement different types of data structures and running tests on everything (taking into account the memory and having **no memory leaks** in any of the projects).
## WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT
1.***Good understanding about Algorithms***

2.***Good understanding about Abstract Data Types***

3.***Knowledge about pointers and memory management***
